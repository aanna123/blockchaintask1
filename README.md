What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed, immutable digital ledger system where data is stored in linked blocks, each connected to the one before it using cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a set of transactions or data, a timestamp, a hash of its own contents, and the hash of the previous block. This structure forms a continuous, verifiable chain of data blocks, ensuring that no information can be altered retroactively without modifying all subsequent blocks.
Blockchain operates without a central authority, relying instead on decentralized consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate new data entries and maintain network security.

Real-life Use Cases:

Supply Chain Management:
Blockchain improves supply chain transparency and product traceability, reducing fraud and errors by recording the entire journey of goods from origin to destination.

Digital Identity:
Provides decentralized, secure identity management, giving users control over their personal data and protecting against identity theft and misuse.
