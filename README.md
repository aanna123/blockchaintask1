Blockchain Basics
What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed, immutable digital ledger system where data is stored in linked blocks, each connected to the one before it using cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a set of transactions or data, a timestamp, a hash of its own contents, and the hash of the previous block. This structure forms a continuous, verifiable chain of data blocks, ensuring that no information can be altered retroactively without modifying all subsequent blocks.
Blockchain operates without a central authority, relying instead on decentralized consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate new data entries and maintain network security.

Real-life Use Cases:

Supply Chain Management:
Blockchain improves supply chain transparency and product traceability, reducing fraud and errors by recording the entire journey of goods from origin to destination.

Digital Identity:
Provides decentralized, secure identity management, giving users control over their personal data and protecting against identity theft and misuse.

| Index: 1             |
| Timestamp: 2025-06-09|
| Data: "Txn Details"  |
| Previous Hash: abc123|

Merkle Root & Data Integrity:

A Merkle root is the single topmost hash in a binary tree of transaction hashes, representing the combined integrity of all transactions in a block. It is derived by repeatedly hashing pairs of transaction hashes until one final hash remains.

Example:

If a block has transactions T1, T2, T3, T4:

Hash T1 & T2 → H1

Hash T3 & T4 → H2

Hash H1 & H2 → Merkle Root

Why it matters:
If any transaction is altered, its hash changes — this change propagates up the tree, altering the Merkle Root and immediately signaling that tampering has occurred.

Consensus Conceptualization
Proof of Work (PoW):
A consensus mechanism where miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles (typically by finding a hash with a certain number of leading zeroes). The first to solve the puzzle gets to add a block to the chain and earns a reward. It consumes large amounts of computational energy as many miners attempt this puzzle-solving simultaneously to maintain the blockchain's security.

Proof of Stake (PoS):
Instead of solving puzzles, validators are selected based on how many coins they stake (lock up as collateral). The higher the stake, the higher the chance of being selected to validate the next block. It’s much more energy-efficient than PoW, reducing environmental impact while maintaining network security through financial incentives.

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):
An advanced version of PoS where stakeholders vote to elect a limited number of trusted delegates (validators). These delegates are responsible for validating transactions and adding new blocks. It’s faster, more scalable, and democratic, though it risks centralization if a small group of delegates dominates the voting process.
